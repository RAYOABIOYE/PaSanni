                <h1>THE ERINLE EXPANSION</h1>
                <h5>Having attained a high degree of socioeconomic stability in Adeagba, his inborn adventurous zeal made the expansion of Sanni‚Äôs farming business space irresistible. So, just as his Father discovered and expanded into Adeagba, Sanni‚Äôs thirst for a greener pasture landed him in yet another virgin but fertile land, the ERINLE VILLAGE, located within the present day Ado Odo Local Government Area.
                    On arrival in Erinle with his family made of Iya Onijogi and Iya Alaro, his second and third wife respectively and some of his children, Sanni was warmly hosted as a new migrant by the some AWORI PEOPLE who were the first set of settlers in the Erinle Village. Iya Adeagba, the first wife was left to hold forte in Adeagba.
                    At Erinle, Sanni soon became an owner of some expansive land space and cocoa farmer with a workforce majorly made of his wives and children
                    Apart from farming activities, Islamic religious activism also highlighted Sanni‚Äôs life in Erinle where he rose to become the Chief Imam of the Village Central Mosque, although a convert.

                <h1>THE KOMI EXPANSION</h1>
                <h5>Again, Sanni took his cocoa farming business to the next level as he expanded in another farm settlement called the KOMI VILLAGE, ably supported by his DAUDU (First Child ‚Äì Surakat), thereby acquiring some additional landed property.</h5>

                <h1> Original Egba Town</h1>
                <h5> 
                    The original town and settlement of the Egba nation was under and around Olumo rock, which is in Itoko area, in the Egba Alake. 
                    The Jagunna of Itoko, is the Chief Priest of Olumo. The area in Ikija, which is within the Oke Ona division, is only an Amusement Park created as an entrance to the Park. The entire Olumo Rock is in the territory of, and under the control of the Itokos. 
                    Another reference name for Abeokuta by the founding fathers is Oko Adagba (Adagba's Farm or Bush) in reference to the hunter that founded / discovered Olumo rock. Adagba went hunting in search of game animal/food from the Obantoko township where his fellow Itoko citizens were stationed while wandering for a settlement. 
                    Egbaland is a very important city with a rich history of civilization. For instance, it was the city where Henry Townsend lived. Also, it is the home of the first newspaper in Nigeria ("Iwe Irohin"). Its people serve as the first of the many Nigerian nations (until recently, the only of them) to have had an anthem.
