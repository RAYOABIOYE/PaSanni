                <div class="text3a">
                    <h5>
                        The Sanni Abioye Family is a large African extended family which hails from the Gbagura section of the Abeokuta city of Ogun State, Nigeria. As a Yoruba family, it has its original roots in Ile-Ife, the founding source of the entire ethnic group. 
                        <span id="dots">...</span>
                        <span id="more">
                            The Aroyewun family of the Ajigbayin Compound, Iremo, Ile Ife in the present-day Osun was, according to history, the home of Pa Odunola Aroyewun, the man who migrated from Ile Ife while a boy and who gave birth to Sanni Abioye the Progenitor of the Sanni Abioye Family. 
                
                            Since the birth of Sanni Abioye in 1856, over five generations made of his direct children, grandchildren, grand grandchildren, great grandchildren, and great-grandchildren have been emerging and thriving across the Yoruba, Nigerian, and global landscape.
                
                            The Sanni Abioye Family House situated at Onagboro within the Ija Ofa axis of the Gbagura section of Egba Land is a major symbol and physical heritage of the Family. 
                
                            In terms of economic history, the business of farming, particularly cocoa farming, is a traditional vocation of the Abioyes, many of whom have also been reputable for trading. In fact, the trading vocation as well as the civil service profession has turned a large populace of a Yoruba-speaking family into a bilingual one which, to date, has Hausa as its second language. In Jos, Kano, Sokoto, and many other northern cities, residential buildings which served as the extension of the Sanni Abioye Family House existed till the early 1980s.
                
                            The status of the Abioyes, whose traditional praise name is 'Omo Alaaye', as a civilized African Family that is ever-growing, ever-flourishing, and ever-progressing is rooted in the tradition of competitive educational pursuits and legal economic striving across global borders which combine to signal a tomorrow that will always be better than today.

            <h3>THE ROOT AND FOUNDING MIGRATION</h3>
            <h5>The Sanni Abioye Family has its root in the Ajigbayin Family of Oke-Iremo, Ile Ife, the historical source of the Yoruba Race.
                By birth, the direct Progenitor of the Family is Alhaji Odunola, son of Pa Ariyewun of the Ajigbayin Family who was blessed with many female children mixed with only two male â€“ Odunola and his younger brother.
                These two boys, early in their lives, were moved from their Oke-Iremo Family Compound to live with their maternal Aunt in Modakeke, Ile Ife, from where they were finally taken to Abeokuta by their host Family to resettle.
                A notable co-migrant was another adolescent named Olatidoye, a cousin to Odunola, son to his Maternal Aunt and Caretaker.
